# QAOREU
MATLAB Codes for graphing and viewing results for the 2024 NSF QAO REU at The University of Tennessee

*BoseHubbardEx is a worked example of finding entaglement for 2 bosons on 2 sites.

*QMCvsTheoryLN2 graphically compares the calculated ground state for 2 bosons on 2 site Bose Hubbard to the values from Julia QMC.

*nlgraph compares energies for different particle arrangements in QMC to understand system behavior.

*SimplifiedL3matrix finds the eigen values and ground states for the 3 boson on 3 site case, and compares to case with nmax = 2, and graphs them accoridingly.

*QMCvsTheoreticalforLN3 compares the calculated ground state for 3 bosons on 3 site Bose Hubbard to the values from Julia QMC.

*groundstaterelerror graphs the errors between ground states for 3 bosons on 3 sites with and without nmax, and implementing U'.

*l3entanglement calculates and graphs spatial and particle entanglement for 3 bosons on 3 sites as U' increases.

*inlaid figures graphs ground state energy and the corresponding error in the same figure for increasing U' in 3 boson 3 site case.
